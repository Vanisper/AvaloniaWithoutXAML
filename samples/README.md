# Samples

These directories each contain a self-contained sample. That is, you can download
them individually to build and run their samples. None of them depends on any of
the others.

Even if you don't actually download all of them, you can learn a lot about how to
use Avalonia without XAML by reading the comments in the source code.

A good learning path would be this order.
